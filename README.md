# Adhjie-Discussion
Repo to keep track of my convos across the internet, Mostly PrivSecAnon.
Second usage is 'to solve YouTube deleting comment with links'. By saying to the OP of my convo, to check the referenced links at github.com/Adhjie/Adhjie-Discussion instead.
Third usage: Also to solve sharing draft to reddit post as comment.
More usages to come.
